## Hey, I'm **[gonza](https://www.gonza.gr/)**
It's good to see that you have been interested in understanding this repository.
<br><br>



I want to thank JavaScript Mastery ([jsmastery.pro](https://www.jsmastery.pro/)) 
who was my guide in the development adventure of this project, 
during the **[Build and Deploy an Amazing 3D Web Developer Portfolio in React JS | Beginner Three.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fYi8SGA20k)** ðŸš€<br><br><br>



ðŸ“Œ **LIVE DEMO: _https://www.gonza.gr/_**

[![Personal Website Demo Preview](https://i.postimg.cc/HkmHQMPK/preview-demo.png)](https://www.gonza.gr/)

<br><br><br>


#### Project Setup:
```bash
npm create vite@latest ./ --  --template react
```

#### Installing one of the best CSS frameworks:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
```
(the -D flag in Tailwind CSS enables development mode, providing additional utility classes and features during compilation. It enhances the development process but should be avoided in production builds to keep the final CSS file optimized)
```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```
